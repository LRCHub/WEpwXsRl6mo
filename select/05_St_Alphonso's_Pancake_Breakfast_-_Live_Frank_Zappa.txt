St Alphonzo's Pancake Breakfast
Yes indeed
Here we are

At St. Alphonzo's Pancake Breakfast
Where I stole the margarine
And wheedled on the Bingo cards
And blew up the latrine

I saw a handsome parish lady
Make her entrance like a queen
While she was totally in chenille
And her old man was a Marine

As she abused the sausage pattie
And said, "Why don't you treat me mean?"
